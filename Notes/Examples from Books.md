### Grim Dark

Stephen King Fairy Tale: He used short abrupt sentencing to insinuate a gloomy depressed atmosphere. When Charlie's mom died, the sentence structure was more choppy and sounded more like he was moving from one thing to the next just trying to get things done.

The words and imagery that he used during the dark days of his moms passing and dad's alcoholism worked perfectly to paint a dark and gloomy time in Charlie's life.

The gold broker that Charlie goes to see seems very dark and foreboding. I think he does this by showing the apprehension that Charlie is thinking towards the man. There is a little more ominous feel to the room by the broker asking more direct and terse questions. Grabbing Charlie's arm would have been very freaky.
