- The tone is very... reverent maybe? Maybe somber? It certainly feels more monk like

	- There was the zealous fire interaction
	- There was the Ascension but we didn't really see his feelings on it other than what culture told us he should feel.
	- It seems that he is a character in a story rather than you are telling us his story.
