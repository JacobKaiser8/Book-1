*These are not laws that must be followed for a story. They just work well for Sanderson's books. They are well thought through and can be easily followed and adjusted accordingly.*

# 1st Law
## Your ability to solve problems with magic in a satisfying way is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic

This is a law of foreshadowing.

You can have soft magic and hard magic in the same book. It can be nice to have the two juxtaposed. Examples being **LOTR** and **Name of The Wind**. You don't need to have the magic hard defined in the book and in fact, you may want a little bit of whimsy in the book to allow the reader to gain anticipation from discovering what the magic system is.

> "Make the characters stretch to solve the problems they have with the tools they are given rather than solve the problem externally" - Brandon Sanderson

When the reader is able to understand how the magic is used, the magic is a tool for the reader to understand how the story **could** play out. This gives the reader the ability to puzzle out on there own.

When the reader **thinks** they understand how the magic system works, it can create an opportunity to introduce something new that can catch the reader off guard. Don't use this method as a scapegoat rather as a introduction. The example given is in hallmark movies, the main character is often saved by the love interest more as a way of introducing them. This can be the same for magic or fantasy elements, using them as the saving key as an introduction rather than a "get out of jail free card".

LOTR movie \#2 and LOTR movie \#3:

In LOTR the Two Towers, Helms Deep is being defended until the point that Gandalf said that he would come. There was the anticipation that they had to hold out. Then when Gandalf showed up with his riders, there was the anticipation and the climax thereof. The riders were written in to be out and Gandalf was written in to be going to get them.

In LOTR the Return of the King, Minas Tirith has to win the fight or else all of mankind will fall. Aragorn goes off and finds the skeleton king and saves the day. There isn't as much of a build up/ promise of saving coming and just hoping that the saviors will come. Rather the saving of the day comes out of no where and can feel more like a scapegoat. Aragorn just happened to go look for them and found them. The lore of them was not told in the movie very well.

# 2nd Law
## Limitations/flaws/costs are more interesting than powers

This is a law for character building.

Limitations can create more interesting story telling than the powers themselves. You can craft more around how characters are getting around the limitations than you could with how their magic makes them cool.

One example: Superman stories are more interesting when: someone has shown up who can punch harder than superman, someone has kyptonite and so superman can't use his powers, superman can't use his powers to overcome the problems.

When developing magic, naturally you will err towards conflict. 
- the character is not skilled enough with their magic yet and so need to level up
- something is broken in their magic and so they need to find the fix and then be able to use the magic in the correct way
- magic is not the solution to the problem and I need to use my other attributes to solve the problem

Costs can be something like a physical resource. Equivalent to bullets in a gunslingers gun. The character will use this resource and run out of it when the author deems it literarily convenient. Can tie this form of cost into an economy. No need to invent a reason that the character doesn't have their power, you just deny them the resource. can be used as a literary element as a journey to acquire the resource.

Strict costs like 3 wishes. 

Fun small powers for humor/emotion not for problem solving. Can be great. Make sure that the powers don't have significant consequences on the whole world.

# 3rd Law
## Expand what you already have before you add something new

This is a law for setting building

You want to have enough for the reader to be interested in however, you want to have minimum enough to be able to have something to latch onto. It is better to have less done really well rather than 10% done on a lot of other options.

Only do what you absolutely need for a story only hinting that the rest is there. This allows the readers imagination to grow and discover on their own. Having a massive history of things isn't required, but hinting that there is a massive history of things allows the reader to imagine what could have happened allowing them to not go deep into it and move forward with your story.

# Zeroth Law
## Err on the side of AWESOME

Be clear for yourself that the cool idea is the goal. The rest of the rules help with that. If they don't help then throw them away.
