Why do we want to do "world building"?
- Impossible made possible
- Themes
- Sense of wonder and exploration
- "Cultural butterfly effect"
- Explore real world issues in an abstract world
	- Explore difficult ideas in an approach that isn't immediately polarizing
- "Play God"

The setting is what defines the genre as sci-fi fantasy/fantasy works. Generally that is the least important part of the story. Your time is best spent making interesting and engaging characters, then making an interesting plot, with last being the setting.

There is the worry that we get so engrossed in world building that we miss or even undermine the story that we are trying to tell. It is important that we have a good world in our story but it should act as a service to the story and not something that bogs the story down. It can be big and important to the story but its not the billboards on the way to the story

If you can convey the setting of the world through the eyes of the character, that is a much more engaging way than giving an expositional dump. You want to convey as a result of building your characters.

Avoid the encyclopedia entry.

Get more of the exposition into dialog. Be careful to not have dialog that is simply exposition. Its just another form of encyclopedia. It feels stilted and it doesn't feel like their own sincere motivations.

Give the reader a little less than you think that they need. 

Pyramid of Abstraction:
	- The goal of your descriptions is to form a base of the pyramid. You ground the reader in a story so that when you go higher into the lore there is less feeling that the author is pulling the reader out
	- You lay the ground work with concrete language. The reader is very firmly set in the world and time. So when the character is moving along and starts talking about the magic and over world, the reader is not lost out in the aether of the mind. I feel this a lot with audio books. 
	- The reader gets lost really fast in an audio book if they aren't paying attention. 
	- If you give a lot of descriptions to something, giving it concrete descriptions, it will allow the reader to imagine exactly what you want.
	- More description is not always the better way to go. The more words will also bog the reader down. Use meaningful words the best that you can so that the reader is flowing with the scene. Tell then Show is an organization thing but we don't need it. We don't need a thesis before showing what it is. Get rid of the passive voice, too many adverbs, too many descriptors. (Very mad vs irate)

Start with the character in a scene that they are trying to get something that they want. This doesn't have to be the main plot. Work with the character trying to get the thing they want and only use the world building that works with that scene.

Often times it is good to lead with the magic if you do it through the eyes of the character.

Apprentice plots were big in the 80's because someone would learn about a fantastical world and the reader would follow along with the apprentice as they learn. The 90's brought being thrown into the magical worlds. Harry Potter is a "portal fantasy" where they are thrown into the fantasy world through some sort of portal.

How does the setting enhance the story it is trying to tell?
- John Wick
	- The world is established on the rules of the world of assassins
	- John Wick is the best of them all by showing how cool everyone else is
	- The setting is established as a "spy world" allowing the viewer to know where they are
- Avatar the Last Airbender
	- They introduce water bending on the hunt. The water bending helps them to accomplish that
	- World building based on the elements coming together
	- Why the fate of the universe is in a 12 year old's hands
	- Anything that has become a cliche can't stop being a cliche if its done really well
	- Uses the map as a story building. Allows the map to tell the story
- Firefly
	- Establish a universe that you are small in a system
	- Show that the system can't be circumvented
	- Characters in a rebellion that lost
	- The reavers are shown to be really scary which allows for a fear in the world
	- Safety of the ship
- The Expanse
	- Everything is dangerous and there isn't a winning solution
	- Uncaring universe
	- Political tension or something is broken and needs to be fixed
- Dune
	- The spice is a fantastical resource and allows it to be the lynch pin piece of the story

# How Brandon Builds a World
## Physical

Everything that would exist in the world without sentient beings. If you removed the sentient beings what would remain? Ex. Map, flora and fauna, weather, magic, etc.

## Cultural

Everything that would be there with the people. Ex. Religion, government, gender roles, food, borders, fashion, history, rites of passage, hierarchy, accents, languages, taboos, military tradition,  swear words.

Do a few of these really well and fill in with the others. You can interconnect them into the others. The focus is on one thing but as it is developed it feeds into the others. Allow the physical to affect the cultural. Taboos can be very fascinating. Explanations are not as important as making them feel real.
