# Questions from the Audience
## Internal consistency

This is logic that is consistent with the story. This is usually very important for most stories. You may want to have a small external logic to make the magic feel more real.

## External Consistency

This is logic that is consistent with real world systems: physic, chemistry, biology. In sci-fi you want to allow people to make the slight jump to your new tech. If you are going to go against internal logic, you need to put work in on the front hand. This will take more work but will allow the world to be manipulated without the reader getting confused/hung up on things.

General rule is age of Protagonist +2 is who the book is intended for. You can create themes that bump the book up in age.

The way that the reader interfaces with the story is more important than what the author is saying about the story. Always what are you telling the reader about the story not so much what you want the story to be.

Don't spend too much time world building because then you will never write the story.

Q: How do you know if your magic system works?
A: Magic is a tool to achieve goals. Does magic help the protagonist to achieve those goals? Does it help the reader to reach a similar conclusion?

You can go back and foreshadow. Brandon adds a note to come back and foreshadow after he is done.

## Revisions
Brandon doesn't write the spren into his first draft. He adds his spren in during the second draft.

If we you hate revisions, try to make a plan to make the revisions better along with the book. Don't let the revisions change your book so much as making your book better.
