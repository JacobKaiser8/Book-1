## How to make readers care about your character
A magic system is only as interesting as the people using it. 
Brandon outlines plot and setting and then his characters he "casts". The characters fit into the setting and plot rather than the story revolving around the character.

### 1. Establish Empathy
Likeability
- We show that they are like us in some way. They have relatable problems or features
- We can make them nice. If we want someone to like a character they save a cat if we want someone to hate a character they kick a dog.

Show people liking them
- We will instantly like someone who is liked by other people
- Show the character having a family or friends

### 2. Establish Rooting Interest
You are going to show that what the character wants is interesting to us. Give the character motivation.

- You want to have a character want something. Something out of life that they generally can't have. What do they want and why can't they have it? This will drive flaws, handicaps, limitations.
- Establish a personal connection to the plot. Make a reason that the protagonist is connected to the plot.

### 3. Progress
- Show a Flaw or some journey they are going to go on.
- Shows a sense of mystery
- What is suppose to change in the character. What of their personality will undergo the change and allow the reader to be interested and follow the journey
