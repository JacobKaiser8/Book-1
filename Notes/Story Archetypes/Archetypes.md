- **Betrayal** 
	- The empire betrays Marcus's concept of what the Empire is to him.
	- Those in the empire betray Marcus's image of them
- **Revenge**
	- Marcus is bent of avenging his friend (This needs to be made a little stronger)
- **Survival**
	- Marcus needs to survive captivity
- **War**
	- The world will be in a full on war
	- The emotion and turmoil that comes with war and invasion could be shown here
- **Discovery**
	- Marcus discovers the deific world beyond his own
	- The discovery of new power
- **Fall then Rise then Fall**
	- Marcus falls from his good life in his home land
	- Marcus rises to someone of importance to keep his country safe
	- Marcus falls realizing that he has helped to facilitate the subjugation of a people
	- Marcus rises to the occasion to redeem himself and save the world then sacrifices himself to save the world
