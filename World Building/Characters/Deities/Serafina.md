- Deity of Fire
- Born in the beginning of the story
- Power of fire
	- Starts with warming
	- Hard to control
	- Similar to fire bending
	- Can summon flames on anything the [[Fire Born]] is touching
	- Use of fire magic increases heat inside a person
		- The limit to the magic is the amount of heat that one person can withstand
		- Primus is at an advantage because he has seared his arms and legs
	- Control levels
		- #LowSkill:
			- heat ones body
			- conjure flames on surfaces
			- only able to control amount of flames relative to ones ability to handle body temp
				- As a result can burn away ailment
		- #MediumSkill:
			- can create uncontrolled explosions of heat around ones self. Can kill the user or make unconscious
			Specific Magic Skills
				- fireballs
					- stored heat when thrown then hits against object explodes
					- wielder puts fire and energy into one location and creates the fireball with control
						- lower control creates large balls with less impact explosion
						- higher control fireballs can be made in one had with higher impact explosion
				- spray fire
					- spray fire in an arc
				- combustion
					- explode around ones self
				- touching people and igniting them
					- speed at which the fire spreads will be determinate on the skill of the user
				- imbue weapons with fire
					- fire weapons like lightsabers
					- ice fails to fire, absorbed lightning amplifies the heat, wind doesn't affect, Earth is unaffected by fire
					- weapon has to be compatible to fire i.e. wood staffs/swords etc. are consumed
					- Steel weapons are the best. Other metals only allow for a weaker amount of fire
			- cover limbs in flames to augment physical combat
			- can exude internal heat like a heat venting allowing for more use of fire
				- when venting, the flames can not grow as much because the heat is not being stored. Someone venting cannot create as intense of flames as someone who is storing heat
				- can pass heat to environment/people around them
		- #HighSkill:
			- fire bender
			- can control fire directionally using hands/feet/mouth/; jets of fire, create swords of flame with concentrated heat
				- Since flames come from the wielder, shoes are not reasonable when controlling fire through the feet
			- can store heat within a heat sink of some sort allowing for heat sink limited use of power + user
				- heat sinks can be swords, amulets, armor.
			- effortless of directional heat
			- can propel ones self through the air
				- not like wind who can basically fly with precise control, but more like a rocket that gets propelled in a direction
					- I guess you could control fire to a stop. but remaining in one place would be difficult with only 4 directions. Not possible to have a spacecraft omni direction air jets for control
