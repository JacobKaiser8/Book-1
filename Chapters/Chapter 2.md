Marcus let himself become part of the crowd. In this smaller street outside of the Academy, the crowd was much more dense. He recalled being told that before the protective wall was put in place, the street was much wider allowing for faster foot traffic and a much less dense crowd. Today he was happy to be able to seamlessly blend into it and towards freedom.

  

With the academy being on and the docks being on opposite sides of the city, and with the prospect to interact with as many exciting foreigners as he could, he set off in the direction that most directly led away from where he came. 

  

Being taller than most citizens, Marcus was able to see over the heads of the people in the crowd and observed that the majority of people were heading east, towards the still rising sun. Hoping to first reach the main street that fed all the districts of the city, he considered to himself, “This better be the direction of the main street. If I get lost trying to get there, I’ll waste half the day just trying to get my bearings.”

  

The fear of getting lost began to creep into his mind as he followed a large group winding through the back streets. If he got lost trying to find the street, would he also not be able to find his way back in time before the night guard was posted on the walls? 

  

As the doubts began to take over and Marcus began to regret his decision, the street opened up into the Great Plaza, Piazza de Devozione. Relief washed over him as he immediately recognized his location. 

  

The plaza was constructed when the city was first founded and remained the central hub of everything important. Although still as grand as the day it was built, the plaza had grown and morphed throughout the years. The estates that used to house rich nobles were instead converted to where the rich nobles work; bankers, lawyers, tax collectors, money changers, and the largest building of all was the local government building. In the center of the plaza a market had grown. There weren’t any permanent buildings erected, but stalls and carts of every kind trying to sell their wares to those that worked in the ring around them. A hoard of people accumulated around the market with those that worked in the outlying buildings pathing to and from them. 

  

Running north to south, pausing in uniformity only through the plaza, was the main street. The street ran from the docks on the shore all the way out to the city and straight on to the capital of the Constituto Empire, [Capital name here]. It was the widest and longest street of Dormiens Ignis, possibly the whole empire, Marcus hadn’t ventured out enough to know for sure.

  

Feeling significantly more relaxed about his situation, now having confidence in his orientation in the city, he took the time to take in his surroundings. The first thing that he noticed was the cacophony of smells in this area. As he walked around the plaza he could smell more than just unwashed bodies of the citizens around him. There were smells of fresh bread brought in for the day, cheese wheels freshly opened, and wine made from the vineyards of the Agricoltura region of the Empire. Mixed in with the delicious scents was the sour smell of fresh fish hauled in from that day’s catch. All sizes were brought to this market and even some with long slippery legs instead of fins.

  

Marcus heard his stomach grumble and decided that it wouldn’t hurt if he took a minute to find himself some breakfast. He had run into Eva on his way to the cafeteria and instead of eating he then proceeded to have Jason commit arson, evaded the academy guards, and vaulted a wall that was meant to protect him from would-be invaders. He was probably more starved than his stomach was letting on, plus the smell of cheese and fruit caused the groans of hunger to increase as he made his way to the central markets.

  

Marcus pinpointed a few stalls there were nestled together strategically displaying their bread, cheese, and grapes respectively. Marcus observed that they probably had the orientation on purpose knowing full well that when someone bought from one of them, they would be more likely to pair one purchase with another. Marcus was suckered into their carefully planned stratagem. He fished out a few of the coins from his side satchel and began counting to see how much he could really get for the morning. 

  

As he completed counting the last coins he looked up and locked eyes with one of the patrolling soldiers. He was not one of the slouching academy guards, this was a real protector of the city. Muscles hardened through daily drills, dark short cropped hair, and armor that glinted in the late morning sun. As the soldier locked eyes with Marcus he immediately identified him as a student of the academy, not hard when Marcus was still dressed in his own school uniform. The soldier swiveled to toward Marcus, squaring his shoulders and firmly commanding the crowd to “Make way! Legionnaire coming through! Make way!”.

  

The combination of the soldier's hard dark eyes locked on him and loud booming voice, froze Marcus in place. Years of martial respect to the point of almost worship had resulted in a very obedient people and Marcus was no exception. The Legionnaire was quickly closing the distance between the two, his gaze never diverting from Marcus. Marcus snapped out of his awed trance and began frantically looking for an escape. The soldier was nearly within reach stretching forth his hand to apprehend Marcus when Marcus made the rash decision to run.In his haste, he dropped the coins from his hands, pinging off the ground as he took off. 

  

People were already looking his way from the soldier bellowing his orders and were quick to stand aside as Marcus came barreling through the crowd. Knowing full well that although fully weighed down in armor, he would never be able to outrun a fully conditioned Legionnaire of the Constituto Empire, Marcus decided he might have an advantage with his better mobility and began weaving through the confusion of stalls and people. 

  

He had mostly recovered from his endeavor over the wall but his muscles immediately started to burn again as he took off. “This chase will not last long if I don’t lose him and FAST,” Marcus thought. “This contest was going to be like a dire wolf catching a lame rabbit if I try to simply out distance him.” Marcus frantically searched for a way out as he maneuvered through the people. He bummed over a basket of shiny red apples and the merchant shook his first at him, his face beat red in anger, yelling something profane. Sparing a glance for the apples and the vendor that was screaming at him, Marcus caught a glimpse of the soldier closing in rapidly. Continuing his escape Marcus reached the end of the market and ran in the direction of the buildings on the outer ring, still not seeing a way out. 

  

He pumped his legs hard, his fists keeping in time with his feet as he ran. As the buildings began to loom over him, he spotted a possible refuge. There was a waste alley. Not typically for human travel, they were barely 60 cm wide. They were slightly angled downward so that the nobles from the windows above could dump their refuse and then have it flow into the sewage tunnels underneath the city. These tunnels were an astounding feat of engineering from the Empire and was one of the reasons the citizens never saw plague in their cities. Marcus twisted his face in disgust as he thought of the possibility but in this moment he needed the narrow passageway to provide him an escape and prevent him from starting this school year over again.

  

Mustering what remained of his stamina, he raced towards the opening of the sewage lane. As he reached the narrow opening, he spared a glance to see that the patrolman was almost on top of him. He wiggled his way into the passage trying to avoid the thought of the muck and human filth that would be lining the walls. His stomach and back, he could do nothing about touching the walls but he pulled his lips inward and tried to not twist his head to where his nose would brush up against the film of filth. 

  

He felt a tug as the soldier caught up to him and latched a finger on his tunic. Marcus dipped his shoulder to loosen the finger from his tunic and continued to shuffle forward. The single finger gripping him wasn’t significant enough to put up any resistance and the guard, dedicated to his training, was too muscular to make it into the narrow passage. Marcus did not spare a glance back and continued shuffling toward the other side of the old noble houses. The reek that was emanating from the walls and floor was becoming too much for his senses, his eyes beginning to water. 

As he exited the passageway and onto the street again, he sucked in lungfuls of fresh air. To his dismay the fresh air of the open street was tinged with the sour smell of the filth on his clothes. The citizens that saw him come out of the passageway held their hands to their noses and gave him a wide berth, casting disgusted glares his way. Marcus sighed knowing that now he could do nothing to blend into any crowd. “This trip is going to be over before I ever get to the docks,” he thought to himself.

  

Resolving to at least glimpse the blue-green shine of the salty sea before being hauled back to the academy, he headed in the direction that he imagined paralleled the main street of the city and toward his goal. Although not fully aware of his orientation in the city anymore, people around him were backing away from him, providing Marcus a quicker pace in the direction he was headed. 

  

Looking around as he walked down the uneven street, Marcus noticed that he had come out into the prostitution district. “Or course they keep the women right behind the important people” he contemplated with disgust. Although he had a hard time pulling his eyes from the women that passed by in plunging necklines and lifted skirts. A few watched him with fluttering lashes and beckoned him to move over to him. He was so distracted that he almost ran straight into the wall with the phallus pointed like an arrow toward the “special company” offered that direction. Nervously looking back at the now laughing girls, he picked up his pace and carried on.

  

He continued past the tanners, and the black smiths. The leather workers and the forges.  All these trades hidden in the throng so as to not distract any visitors from the vibrant foods and festivities that were offered closer to the Plaza. After several minutes of trudging down the street, he could start to smell the salt water being heated off the sea by the early afternoon sun, wafting through the air. The filth on himself must have also begun to dry out enough to point that the overpowering aroma was no longer the only thing filling his nostrils. He quickened his pace in anticipation and sure enough, around the next bend he could see it.

  

The street and buildings seemed to perfectly frame the scene for him. The shimmering light of the sun reflecting off the waves of the sea like diamonds sparkling across its surface. The calm waters lapping against the shore enticing fisherman and traders alike to wade into the cool pool. The white sails of numerous ships dotted in all directions. It appeared as if the water went on forever out into a great infinity, the docks providing safe harbor for all the ships that came to berth there. 

  

The docks themselves were crowded with all the various types of ships from around [insert world name]. If this was the side of the city that moored the military craft, he would have seen the uniformity and strength of the Empire’s armada. However, this was the place for commerce! As such he saw ships of every culture and people. From the long and slender crafts, perfect for ferrying its passengers swiftly to their destination to the barges that were heavy with cargo. The bellies of these crafts bulged into the water like an overweight feline laying on a plush cushion. Mixed in with the Constituto ships were exotic ships of the other countries. Among them were ships that looked like houses atop four canoes, the house portion being supported atop a platform that spanned two of the canoes with the remaining two stretched out to the sides. Marcus thought it looked like how a spider tried to stay atop the water. There were others that were small in frame with smaller triangular sails, confusing Marcus to how those particular ones could ever cut through the water. There seemed to be no room for the men and the wind would never be able to catch in those sails. But they must’ve had some way of navigating for they made it all the way here. He made a mental note to inquire of those particular vessels.

  

Amongst all the ships were people that looked and dressed equally as diverse as the ships that they arrived on. Fabrics in dark greens and vibrant yellows. Tunics and robes in various layers and cuts. Nothing close to how the citizens of the Empire dressed, modest colors with tunics and skirts that fit more for function rather than for show. Marcus looked down at his filthy school uniform, once white and red, the colors of the Army and cringed at the thought of how he must look to others. 

  

Cutting through his own thoughts, a jolly booming voice called out to him, “Marcus? What are you doing out here?” Marcus whirled around looking to identify the voice, anticipating another flight through the streets from a would-be captor. Instead he saw a large man looking at him more in confusion rather than in contempt. “Galvinious!” Marcus blurted out, letting out the breath he did not realize he had been holding. Galvinious was indeed a large man, just over two meters in height, he carried a belly that belied his fondness for well smoked meats. He was one of the most well known for his ability to cook the most delicious meats. His thick dark hair and full beard was always kept neat and tidy and although letting his weight go, he was a kind and respectable man who worked hard in his day to day. For this reason Alpinious Equites had chosen him personally to be butcher for the Equites family. When Galvinious wasn’t needed at the Equites estate, he would come down to this section of the city and work at his shop where he added onto what he was already generously paid by the Equites family.

  

As Marcus trotted over to him, Galvinious scrunched up his face as held out an outstretched hand halting Marcus’s progress. “You smell like you were shit out of a cow and then pissed on by the bull! What happened to you boy?” Marcus looked down sheepishly, obviously the smell had not dissipated like he had thought. “Come on, let us get that vile odor off you. Just don’t come any closer to me, I don’t need you spoiling my prize today.” Over his shoulder, Galvinious was packing a huge six legged buck. The majestic antlers that would have matched a stag this size, had already been sawn off. He only cared for the succulent meat that would come from the animal.

  

“I’ve never seen a full sized six legged deer before! You’ve only ever brought them to the manor already carved and sectioned out. Where did you get this big guy, Galv?” Exclaimed Marcus, eyes wide with fascination.

  

“Oh yea, this guy is going to be something delicious! You know the four legged ones are decent enough but they don’t grow as big as their cousins here,” Galvinious said with pride as he smacked the belly of the animal making a sound like a deep drum. “You know these only come from Empire plains. Nothing so big could grow anywhere else!” he bellowed with pride. 

  

Marcus remembered one of his lecturers droning on about how the Empire was perfectly positioned on [World name here]. It had only one real mountain, Mount ignis, and the rest stretched out rolling hills, shallow valleys, and clear rivers. This created the perfect conditions for dense forests and meadows where wildlife flourished beyond what was normal. Marcus remembered the lecturer saying something about the overgrown vegetation as well but the animals were the topic Marcus found fascinating. One such creature was the six legged deer that Galvinious was carrying but there were also the extra muscular cows, with legs the size of the great rhinoceros from the Suirlin nation, were a the perfect beast of burden than their smaller counterparts. There were also rabbits the size of a short man that could leap 10 meters in a single bound. With these larger beasts also came some much larger and more ferocious predators as well, chief among them was Galvinious Belatona. When he would come to the manor, Galv would tell Marcus how some of the foreigners would come all the way just to taste the meat that came from these fantastic creatures.

  

Marcus followed Galvinious, at more than just his arms length, and they made their way through the streets and down to his meat shop. Over the roof of the shop he could see the unobstructed view of Mount Ignis standing magnificently in the distance. Galvinious heaved the deer from his shoulder and onto the front counter of his shop. He then picked up an empty barrel positioned in front of the closed door to the shop. “Wait here,” Galv instructed and he walked down the street to the well with the large barrel under his arm. He set the barrel down and with his bulky arms hauled water from the well into the barrel. Marcus watched as he filled it to the brim and then with significant strain lifted the barrel wrapping both meaty arms around it. 

  

He awkwardly waddled up to Marcus, the water from the barrel sloshing over the lip. Then twisting at the waist, spilled the contents all over Marcus immediately drenching him and flushing the filth away. For what seemed like the one hundredth time to Marcus, people scattered away from the impromptu bath as the water gushed out over the cobblestone street. 

  

Galv set the barrel down chuckling to himself, “There you go! Now you don’t smell terrible, only look it! Go wash your hands a little more and then come help me carve up this one” he said once again patting the stag. 

  

Marcus, now sopping wet, looked at the water dripping from his hands not believing he could any more thoroughly wash them off. He gave Galv a sideways glance but trudged off to the well to do as he said. He gave his hands a wash with the water that remained in the bucket, rubbing them together to make sure that there wasn’t any remaining filthy film on them. Shaking his hands out to the side, flicking off the water the best he could, he jogged back to the shop where Galv had laid out a massive cleaver that looked like it would be better suited for chopping trees rather than the flesh of an animal.

  

“That one is mine,” Galv said with a wink as he picked up the cleaver. “You can skin it with this one,” handing Marcus a razor sharp skinning knife. Marcus had seen Galv cutting up animals in the kitchen at the estate but had never done it himself. He looked uneasily at the animal before him as Galv in one swing cleaved off one of the six legs at the hip and handed it to him. “Look, just make one long incision down the length of the leg and then pull the skin back. It’s easier than you think. You do the legs and I’ll handle the hard parts.” 

  

Marcus, still uncertain, pressed the sharp point against the taught skin of the deer and was surprised with how easily the skin cut and split away from the point. He slid the knife down the leg and toward the hoof concentrating to make sure he didn’t dig too deep into the flesh as well as not holding too loose that he slip off and dig the knife into his own flesh. Once he had a slit all the way down the leg, he grabbed the skin and pulled. The skin pulled away from the flesh with a stark ripping sound. He continued yanking at the skin heaving the leg upright to get a better grip as he went around the bone. As he separated the skin from the flesh, he looked up and saw a rack further into the shop with various animal skins hanging from it. He took his own and hung it up with the rest. Once inside the shop he could more clearly see many other animals hanging from hooks on the walls, all freshly skinned and ready to be smoked for the numerous patrons of the day. 

  

“Did you hunt all of these today?” Marcus asked with bewilderment. 

  

“Haha, no! You think I could be running all over the hills and through forests with this weighing me down?” Galv replied, gripping the girth of his belly. “No, no, I let the young ones do the chasing and I do the cutting.” He said with a flourish of his cleaver. “But I do need all these for today, yes. I get enough patrons in a day passing by here that we could make our own battalion of meat hungry warriors!” He moved to begin piling wood inside a back room that appeared large enough to hold what looked like all the carcasses at once. Marcus could see a thick layer of soot lining all the walls and a big thick door with a latch to close the smoke inside. A small hole the size of his fist behind the pile of wood to allow air to the fire and a chimney out the top to allow for the air to cycle out as well. 

  

Galvinious began to heave carcasses into the chamber one by one placing each on an open hook bolted into the wall. Once he was done, he kneeled down with a knife and flint and worked to start a fire. As he did so Marcus’s mouth began to water and his stomach growled with the idea of the deliciously juicy meat. The combination of running almost his whole way here and skipping out on breakfast, Marcus began to feel light headed. He leaned over one hand against the wall and the other on his head. Galvinous stood up from his work, the beginnings of a fire blooming from the pile, and noticed Marcus staggering on his feet. 

  

“Are you ill, boy?”

  

“No, I just haven’t had time to eat at all today, and I haven’t exactly been sitting idle in a classroom like most mornings.”

  

“You should have said something!” he bellowed. To Galvinious it wasn’t a bellow but to those in close proximity and in a confined space, his boisterous voice was booming. He hurried over to a large cast iron oven buried into the floor and opened the lid. A smokey steam spilled out as he lifted a large rabbit's leg and handed it to Marcus. “I always do the rabbits overnight at a much lower heat but much longer so that the flesh is sweet and tender.” Marcus salivated looking at the reddened flesh from the smoking process. Galvinious handed the hot leg to him and Marcus immediately began tearing into it, passing it from hand to hand to avoid the heat from scalding him. It was as Galv had said, sweet and juicy. The smoked edge of the meat was sweet with flavor and the center perfectly tender. Marcus was so consumed with eating that he almost missed Glavinious’s next question. 

  

“So, what are you doing out of school? I’m not your father so I'm not going to punish you, but I need to know in case your father asks me. I don’t want to lie to him.” Galvinious took a seat on a sturdy looking stool, his massive frame dwarfing the diminutive furniture, as he looked Marcus over with a hard gaze.

  

Marcus lifted his head to answer, wiping his mouth with his arm. “I’m tired of being stuck in there. I learn about the world everyday but never get to experience it. When I go out with my handlers we go where they want me to go, not where I want to go. I just wanted a day where I could see the city on my own.” 

  

Galvinious nodded his head slowly, remembering his own youth. Although he wasn’t enrolled in a military academy, he remembered his father showing him each day how to carve a deer, a cow, or rabbit. Showing where to cut to preserve the meat, how to extract the breast from the bone of a chicken, and what was for humans and what was for the dogs. He also remembered being tired of cutting up animals day in and day out, and not getting to go play soldier with the other children. “You have always told me that you want to become a soldier, that you want to join your father’s army. Has that changed?”

  

“No of course not! I’m going to become the greatest soldier the Special Legionnarii has ever seen. But, the lecturers in the academy have no idea what it’s like to be on a battlefield! I am wasting my time there. Talmund doesn’t know about sneaking into a camp of Frostrike barbarians and then having to cut your way out!” Marcus continued through mouthfuls of rabbit meat. “If I am going to become a well honed instrument of death for the Empire I have to see the action rather than just hear about it.”

  

Galvinious smiled amused by his young visitor’s words. “You’re right there! I don’t think Principal Talmund knows the sharp end of a sword from his own pecker!” Marcus choked as he laughed around a mouthful of meat. Galv continued, “Listen, I know that it's hard right now but this is your last year. Once you’re done then you will go and see more of the world. And soon enough, you may be seeing more of the world than you had hoped for. Being a soldier is right tough work. You may want to take your time now and enjoy it before you can’t anymore.”

  

“Enjoy school??” Marcus asked incredulously.

  

“Enjoy having a safe place and a roof over your head. Enjoy having three square meals a day. Enjoy having friends around you. The academy is just one part of your life. Sure, you spend most of your days there now but when you look at it from the outside, from someone in the muck, it's not so bad.”

  

“I’ll tell you it’s not so great on the inside” He mumbled.

  

Galvinious either didn’t hear him or pretended not to. Standing up from his stool he grabbed the skinning knife getting ready to finish the rest of the unskinned deer. “You finish eating that and then come help me finish this. I’ll tell you what, you can work with me for the day and then I'll take you around the docks and show you the great majesty of the city, only if you promise that you’ll finish working hard at that school of yours.”

  

Marcus raised a grimy hand to Galv and he took it in his large paw of a hand. “Deal”

  

Marcus hurried to finish his meal knowing that he would finally get the day he wanted to from the outset of this excursion. It was mid day and he had been running from school, running from guards, and squeezing through filth ridden alleys. He felt he was finally getting what he worked for. 

  

Standing up from where he was positioned on the ground, Marcus felt that his morning breakfast, or early lunch, may not have yet reached his stomach because his legs were still shaking. He put a hand against the wall and realized that no, the whole shop was shaking. He looked up at Galv and he too was gripping the front counter with white knuckled hands, his expression uneasy. The shaking intensified and he saw that it wasn’t just the shop but the whole world outside was rumbling. Thenair itself cracked with an ear splitting noise, a sound like a tree splitting in two boomed over the whole city. Marcus’s ears immediately swelled in piercing pain. He buckled, his hands over his ears and screaming. He could feel himself screaming but could no longer hear anything. 

  

Doubled over in pain, a heavy hand gripped his upper arm and yanked him up. He could see Galv above him moving his mouth as if he was trying to say something but the words weren’t coming out. Marcus realized that Galv was indeed speaking to him, he just couldn’t hear the words. He noticed fresh red blood running from one of Glav’s ears, the other was covered by his hand. Panic ripped through his mind, “What is happening?" Galv shook him again to get his attention and clearly mouthed the words “LET’S GO!” pulling him toward the crowd of people gathering outside.

  

The pain in Marcus’s ears continued to throb, a ringing noise now the only thing he could hear. Marcus and Galv headed towards the door and out into the street. Marcus looked around at the crowd of people standing there like marble statues, frozen in fear, terror etched onto their faces. They were all staring at something on the horizon all in the same direction. Marcus watched Galvinous stop to look as well, looking toward the direction of Mount Ignis. Mouth falling agape and eyes widening to the size of saucers. Marcus turned around slowly, fear of what he was about to see preventing him from moving quickly.

  

The top of the mountain had exploded and was replaced with a stream of fire pillaring into the sky. A cloud of ash billowing ominously out blotting out the sun. The mountain that had once stood as a landmark and monument for all those in the city had suddenly and instantly transformed into the thunderous announcement of their complete destruction.
