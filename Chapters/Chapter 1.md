Chapter 1

  

Marcus Equites walked down the cold marble hall of "The Strategic Academy of Dormiens Ignis". He always thought that was a pretentiously long name. Although the academy was one of the most prestigious military academies in all of the Constituto Empire, it was certainly the most boring place. Marcus had been raised in a military family, specifical an Army family. He had grown to just over 2 meters tall, with athletic features that matched his height. He had light blue eyes that matched the sky over the Empire and shaggy hair that his father wished would be cut to a more military style. 

  

Marcus had been coming to this wretched school for so long he was convinced that by now, if he didn’t have to go through all these pointless classes, he could have been attached to his very own platoon of legionnaires. He could imagine himself fending off the Frostrike barbarians at the northern gates. Or maybe riding along the coast, searching for their raiders. It had been years since any full scale conflict but just the promise of heart pounding action was enough to get Marcus’s mind rolling with possibilities. All these glorious opportunities but his father, Alpinious Equites, General Commander of the armies of the Empire, wouldn’t let anyone join an elite unit before they graduated the academy. Even though Marcus loathed going to school day in and day out, with its dank halls and stuffy lecturers, he wanted nothing more than the glory of being a Praetorian, the Empire’s elite of the elite.

  

Marcus pulled on his sandy blond hair in frustration. He needed to focus on his remaining classes. This was his last year and then he would be deciding which specialization he would dedicate the first years of his military career to. At this point, he wanted any post that would keep him away from an institution of learning. He could hone his skills with the sword as an acolyte of the blade or he could become an artillery corpsman learning how to hurl the largest of boulders at the ramparts of his foes. He had once thought about joining the team that investigated the Yirmiyahu, those of the world that wielded the powers of the gods. He always found it curious how the Constituto Empire was not blessed with any of the powers from the gods. But they did need powers for their success. The last 117 of peace had not been because of the fantastic power of some elementally charged warriors, but with the tactics and cunning of its leaders!

  

Again, Marcus’s mind was swimming with the possibilities that would be before him once he could graduate from this adolescent prison. Focusing on what was in front of him now was going to be its own battle. He was so enveloped in his brooding that he almost ran straight into Eva Classis rounding the corner. She was one of the reasons he could keep doing the mundane, she was the color of an otherwise gray fresco. 

  

Eva was a tall girl with dark brown eyes, and straight brown hair to her shoulders. Marcus imagined her hair was difficult to maintain in the humid air of Dormiens Ignis. Eva was born into one of the great families in charge of the empire's navies. Her father was an illustrious naval strategist successfully protecting the three seas surrounding the peninsula on which the Constituto Empire occupied. The raiders of the Frostrike Kingdom were relentlessly probing the defenses of the Empire and Eva’s father was the first line of defense when they came via the seas. 

  

Eva grew up on the boats of her father which lead to her lithe frame with tight corded muscles. Running up and down the decks of ships, throwing rigging around, rowing the long oars of powerful ships. Marcus’s muscles had phantom pain simply thinking about the exertion that must come from successfully navigating the seas. 

  

Although Marcus and Eva both went to the same academy, they were enrolled in opposing curriculums. Eva was enrolled in studying naval strategies, ship warfare, and merchant convoy defense. On the other side of the military coin, Marcus studied armaments, troop movements, and safeguarding the northern border from their remaining adversary. He seldom got the opportunity to talk to her, and with this being one of those rare occasions, he fumbled for words as he was pulled from his own train of thought.

  

“Oh Eva, I uh.. Didn’t see you there. How’s the water?” Marcus was able to say without sounding too much like a toddler learning his first words. While Marcus mentally berated himself, Eva replied with a raised eyebrow “How’s the water? You do know all my classes are INSIDE the school right? I don’t get to practical classes until next year.”

  

Eva was a year younger than Marcus but the way she conducted herself, Marcus always felt the younger of the two. She knew what she wanted in life and she always had a plan for it. She was unwavering in executing that plan. Marcus knew that one time a counselor tried forcing her to take a more passive class schedule because he thought she wasn’t bulky or sturdy enough for rough waters. Eva promptly went straight to the Empire’s Senator presiding over the navy, and convinced him to write a formal letter outlining the rest of her academic career. It helped that the Senator lived in the adjacent town and was made aware of her father’s accomplishments.

  

Recovering from his previous conversational blunder, Marcus quickly responded “I know, I just assumed that you would be taking any chance you could to get out of here and go down to the docks. You don’t want to see where the real action is?”

  

Eva sighed, “Yes, the docks are so much more exciting than here but there is a reason for being here, Marcus. We are here to prepare for the rest of our careers. We won’t get another chance to spend this much time learning and gathering information. Anything learned here could be the difference between life and death out there.”

  

Marcus, feeling properly chided, broke eye contact with Eva and looked around throwing his hands up. “I don’t know Eva, sometimes it feels like the time here will just go on and on. There is no urgency to get us learning the martial skills we need. I’m going to get out there and the first Frostrike berserker I see is going to cleave me in two.”

  

“You mean you’re not learning how to march in a single file and grunt in those classes of yours?” Eva said in a playfully mocking tone, just short of insulting.

  

"Oh, haha, very funny. You know we grunt first AND THEN march. It's a very complicated technique." said Marcus, feeling more uplifted.

  

"Really though, what are you doing on this side of the campus?” Eva asked. “Principal Talmund is going to find you and then you WILL be outside, in the sun doing drills all day again."

  

Marcus had been lost in his ruminations of his future long enough that he hadn’t noticed the shift from the side of the academy that was reserved for the training of army legionaries to the side that was meant for naval sailors. “I… wanted to see if there was anything exciting on this side of the fight. You know, become more well rounded, learn how to better integrate the two sides of the military.” Marcus said, hoping that his lie made him sound insightful rather than oblivious of his surroundings.

  

Eva just looked at him askance. “Ok fine,” Marcus said exasperated. I am tired of this academy, All the learning and none of the doing. Talmud would rather we never see any action than have us pick up a sword." Eva noticed he had left the Prefect's honorific out. "We've been here for 12 years, entering at the age of 5 and then knowing hardly anything else since. I eat, breathe and sleep battle tactics and yet I haven't seen a single real battle. What's the point of learning about something that you have never even seen!" Marcus exclaimed. "I am the son of the General Commander of the Empire. I think I can learn a lot more from shadowing my father’s day to day than I can here." Marcus continued gesturing to all around him. 

  

“We do go home every weekend, you know.” Eva responded, trying to reign in Marcus’s gloomy thinking. “It’s not like we haven’t seen anything outside of these walls. Besides, you are almost done. You have merely 6 months left until your final iudicium. Then you will be on your way to Specialization School where I imagine you’ll pick up the biggest sharpest sword and promptly cut your arm right off.” As Eva said the last part, she made a slashing motion with her hand into Marcus’s right arm.

  

“Oh ha ha. Very funny.” Marcus laughed lightly. Marcus wasn’t the biggest student at the academy but he figured he would be able to wield a sword well enough. A slight worry of self doubt crept across his mind. Was it actually difficult to wield a sword like those in the practice yard? He would have to file that thought away for later. “I just want one day to go out and see how other people live. Each week is spent here and then every weekend is at home being looked after and monitored by my father’s attendants. It would be nice to just go out into the town and see how people actually lived their lives. I mean, mountain of fire, we’re only one city in this Empire in this whole WORLD. Since the peace treaty forever ago, there is so much more that we can go and see. What I wouldn’t give to go and see the hulking warriors of Tihi Kohatu and their stone hammers!”

  

Eva couldn’t help but think of how great it would be to learn what the scholars from the Chishiki no Kaze could teach her from their millennium of gathering knowledge throughout the world. “May I remind you that the Tihi Kohatu were the ones besieging our cities during the great war? While the Frostrike raided our coasts and supply lines, the Tihi Kohatu came knocking on our gates.” Sha recited this to him as she knocked on his head, mimicking knocking on the gates of the capitol. “I still don’t know how they brokered an alliance with the Frostrike and launched the coordinated invasion on our Empire. Defending on two fronts resulted in many more casualties than if we had simply been fighting the Tihi Kohatu or the Frostrike alone.”

  

“Yes I remember,” Marcus responded while rubbing his forehead on the spot where she had knocked on it. “And although the Frostrike are still a bunch of frozen bastards, the Tihi Kohatu and the Empire reached an… agreement. At least they won’t kill me on sight now. Maybe one day I can be friendly enough with them that I can learn how they get so big.”

  

“I heard they eat special stones in their mountains that then grow into their muscles,” Eva said with a more masculine voice, smacking her biceps in turn. “I’ll bet if you ate some they would only make your head that much harder.” She went to knock on Marcus’s head again but this time Marcus grabbed her hand out of the air by her wrist before she could get to his head. Both smirked at each other for only a moment and then Marcus quickly let go of her wrist.

  

Blushing Marcus continued talking, “I’ll bet I could start by just talking to their merchants that come to port. They sound friendly enough from what my father’s purchasers tell me. I assume they could give me something interesting. In any case, it is way more exciting outside these walls. Let’s just take one day to go out to market and ports and learn what we can that we couldn’t in here”

  

Marcus could see Eva mulling it over in her head. A day out in the warm sun, the smell of the coastal breeze, hearing from interesting people from around the world, it was all very tempting for Eva. “No,” she said abruptly. “I am here to prepare myself for command. I will one day be leading my own ship, and then a fleet. If the sailors that are looking to me for guidance know that at the academy I skipped school and frolicked around the town square of Dormiens Ignis, how am I to keep order and discipline? They need to know that I can do menial things too.  No, you go have your fun in the sun.”

  

Marcus’s shoulders slumped. Going out and exploring the town with no one watchinghim and guiding him from predetermined location to predetermined location would have been way more fun with her along for the ride. “Fine, you stay here and get your tunic starched, I will be learning what this world has to offer. Besides, who needs to be a leader? I’d much rather be down in the action, gaining glory by the strength and skill of my arm.” MArcus made parrying and striking motions as if locked in combat with a foe.

  

"Just don't get caught Marcus." Eva said with a hint of concern in her voice.

  

"Get caught doing what?" Behind Marcus came a nasally voice that each student in "The Strategic Academy of Dormiens Ignis" was all too familiar with. Marcus reeled around to see Principal Talmund, a short and unpleasant looking man. His hair had receded to the crown of his head and thinned out to the point that trying to style it in any way would have zero results. He had squinty eyes, probably from all the sneering he did at his pupils, with shoulders and arms that seemed to hang from his body as though he would rather tell someone to work than lift a figure to do anything for himself. Marcus’s father told him that Talmund got his position because he was good at keeping students in line, but Marcus speculated that it was because he would be a liability on the field rather than any sort of use.

  

“Disciple Marcus please tell me what she is referring to?” Principal Talmund said to Marcus as though he just caught a pickpocket with his purse.

  

“I… uh…” Marcus began but before he could form a plausible excuse for Talmund to eat his sandals and shove off, Eva chimed in. “Marcus was telling me a clever strategy for his final iudicium. When he and his legion have to battle with the other legion he has a clever but risky subterfuge that he intends to enact. However, if he is caught then the mock campaign will fall apart and they will decisively lose.

  

Principal Talmund looked at Eva with some skepticism. She held his gaze long enough that he had no choice but to believe her, her firm determination solidifying her deceit as truth. “Is that the case Disciple Marcus?” Hoping to catch Marcus in a slip up.

  

“Yes.” Marcus said, nodding his head.

  

“Well how about you tell me what this subterfuge is then.” Talmund said, pulling one hand from behind his back where he had them clasped and waving on Marcus to elaborate. 

  

Marcus smirked , “I don’t want to tell anyone else in case it gets out to the opposing side. You will just have to wait till the iudicium. Make sure you’re paying close attention or you might miss it.”

  

Principal Talmund furrowed his brow and stepped close to Marcus. He obviously meant for it to be more menacing, but with Marcus’s height over the man, Marcus grew uncomfortable only because of the proximity. Marcus could smell the fish, lemon, and onions that he must have had for the afternoon meal. “If you think you can overstep me just because you are the son of General Alpinious Equites you may want to rethink your status, Boy.” The last word was said with some vehemence. “I was chosen for this occupation by the Senator’s of Education AND the Senator’s of the Army. Do not think yourself to be more clever or more intelligent than me.”

  

Talmund lingered there for only a moment more before taking a step back and looking to Eva. “And you. If you want to become an admiral in this Empire’s navy, you may want to take another look at who you spend your time with in these halls.” Shifting his gaze once again to Marcus, “Get back to the Army side of the campus. You have no purpose for being over here in the first place. I am late for a lecture on Continued Education in the Military otherwise I would escort you myself. If I catch you in this wing of the building again, I will expel you immediately.”

  

With that Talmund continued on his way leaving the two students behind. Eva turned to Marcus and said, “I am going to get going. As much as I don’t think he can actually expel you, I don’t want to give him another reason to lecture me on my future.”

  

Marcus, knowing that she had her mind set on not leaving for the day, agreed, “I don’t want you to have a more difficult time here because of me. Enjoy yelling ‘land ho’ or whatever it is you sailors do.” They smiled at each other again for a hanging moment. The thought crossed Marcus’s mind to reach out to her and hug her goodbye, but as he did so his stomach started to flutter and his nerves made him freeze up. Eva then turned around and walked away. 

  

Marcus then turned for the exit, smacking himself in the forehead with his palm. “Mountain of Fire!” He exclaimed to himself. “When will you just tell her how you feel!” Mentally moving on he began to enact a quick plan of escape. 

  

The front entrance was guarded by two legionnaires for the day. The students long speculated that the position was more a punishment for incompetence but no one of authority would ever confirm that. There was then a stone wall the full circumference of the academy. In reality it was an impressive fortification. 

  

During the invasion of the Frostrike and Tihi Kohatu, the Frostrike raiders looked to attack the weak points of the cities. In addition, knowing that they could prevent more reinforcements in the long term, they attacked the places of education. It had been a complete slaughter before the local centuria, a squad of 80 legionnaires, could arrive and defend the remaining people. The barbarians killed with no remorse, eviscerating the entire school in some cases all the way down to the new recruits only 5 years old. The Empire quickly learned to fortify and protect their children in the school creating a more fortified location that could be more easily defended. In this time of peace, two guards was all that was required to check who came in and out, but the ramparts would be fully manned in times of conflict. 

  

Marcus was grateful that they weren’t in conflict as that would make this day’s escape impossible. He knew of a location in the wall that had deteriorated enough that he could use the spaces between the bricks as hand and footholds. The only issue was that the guards stood only 90 meters away from that spot. He would need some kind of distraction for the guards to not look his way as he climbed up and over. 

  

As he mulled over what would work for a distraction, he saw Jason Adiutor. He was a boy Marcus’s age but with red hair that was clipped very short and pale skin. He had darting eyes and what some of the instructors said was a “problem with fire”. Jason would tell the other students he liked to see the warm glow that fire brought but Marcus was pretty sure liked to watch things burn. He had a knack for being able to create the smallest of flames from out of nowhere. He always kept a knife of steel and one made of flint on him, where he stashed it no one knew but at any gathering Jason would be the one to start the fire for the food or the torches or “just because there needed to be a fire” Jason would say. Marcus quickly came to the conclusion that Jason would be the perfect cohort in his scheme.

  

“Jason! Thank goodness I found you when I did. I need some help.” Marcus called to Jason. Jason looked around and then jogged over to Marcus sandals slapping on the marble floor. “Listen, I need a distraction,” continued Marcus with his arm now wrapped around Jason’s shoulder. “I need the guards out front to look away for only a moment. If you could maybe… explore your talents on the hanging imperial banners just behind the building's pillars out front, I am sure that would be just enough time.” Marcus had no qualms of fully revealing his plan to Jason. Although he was a strange boy, Jason was friendly with Marcus. They had been in the same classes for their whole academic career and had the same lousy instructors bonding over shared annoyance with their situation. Jason perked up. “You just say when.” Jason quickly said, pulling both his knives out of somewhere unseen and into his hands. Marcus looked at those tools puzzling over where on [World name here] he could hide those things.

  

“I'm going to sneak out the side window in the first room where they teach Basic Infantry Formations. It should be over in about 5 minutes and then I can get through there without anyone seeing me. Once you see me enter the classroom you start the fire and then get out of there. I don’t need them catching you.” 

  

“Where are you going?” inquired Jason.

  

“I’m so tried of this place, I just want to get out for the day.”

  

“Fair enough” Jason replied.

  

Jason never needed more than a simple explanation from Marcus. He trusted what he said and that was that. Marcus never steered him wrong and Jason never let Marcus down. It was a simple friendship of respect. 

  

They split up moving towards their assigned tasks. Jason went to loiter by the front door of this wing of the academy and Marcus by the classroom door down the hall. Marcus could hear the students collecting their papers and scrolls and getting ready to leave. He readied his nerves and waited. 

  

The door to the classroom opened and the 10 year olds of the Basic Infantry Formations class spilled out hurrying on to their next set of instructions. Once the instructor, a tall man wearing the same robed uniform all the instructors wore, exited behind them, Marcus slipped quickly into the room. Moving past the small wooden desks and stools that occupied the room, he jumped up onto the window ledge and lowered himself slowly out so as not to make too much noise and alert anyone else that could be in the area. 

  

He was around the corner from the guards out of sight for the moment. He readied himself looking ahead to where he could see the location on the wall that had been pitted over the years. Rain, wind, and students playing games against that section of wall had caused the edges of the bricks there to crack and fall away leaving just enough for handholds. He would run with everything he had across the 25 meters between the academy building and the wall and then quickly climb up and over. 

  

Edging himself to the corner and peering around he looked towards the guards hoping that maybe they were already distracted by the fire. He could see both men dressed in full legionnaire gear but not fitted as a legionnaire would be if they were to present for war. Their swords wore a little lower on their hips and their boots weren’t cinched all the way up their calves. They weren’t wearing their helmets and instead waited in the shade to protect them from the sun. “Sloppy” Marcus mentally chided them. 

  

One of them was faced the other way talking to a woman with a dress cut quite low revealing much more of her chest than would seem practical. Marcus’s cheeks flushed with warmth as he turned to look at the other guard who was sitting on some sort of crate, head down, picking at his fingernails. He was turned towards the school so that if anyone were to walk in his direction or for example, run up to the wall he would notice them but obviously he was not focused on his job at hand. Marcus cursed to himself, “Spitting fire, would they even see the banners in flames?”

  

Just as Marcus began to come up with a contingent plan, the woman with the low cut dress screamed clutching what little garment she had and pointed at the school. The guards both looked in that direction and with wide eyes and mouths agape, ran towards the school.

  

Marcus could begin to hear the roiling flames as they consumed the silk banners that displayed both the academy name and the Empire Slogan, [Enter Slogan Here]. He watched the guards to make sure that they were past the point that they would see him running the other direction. The one that was picking at his fingernails tripped over the laces from his loose boot and sprawled onto the cobblestone pathway. Marcus could hear his face smacking into the stone as he met the ground. To his credit the legionnaire lifted himself up off the ground, red blood beginning to pour from his nose and kept on moving toward the entrance. Although with a little less haste while he tried to stymie the bleeding as best he could.

  

This was his opportunity. Marcus bolted towards the wall looking to his left to see if the guards could see him. Here he also was able to see the result of Jason’s work. It looked like the whole front of the building was ablaze. He hadn’t lit just one hanging banner, he lit either one on each side and the plants and the red carpet up to the grand entrance into the building. Marcus always felt the red carpet was ostentatious but he didn’t need to light it all on fire. The whole school was made of marble and granite so there was no worry of it actually burning to the ground but he did have to admit that was a bit overboard. 

  

Marcus, confident that there would be no way anyone would be looking his way, looked in the direction of the wall and prepared himself to scramble up and over. He began placing his hands and feet into what seemed to be the most reasonable spots and tried lifting himself up. His foot slipped and he had to try again a few times before he could support his weight and start moving up. This was a lot easier in his head and he began to worry that he wouldn’t be able to make it up the 4 meter tall wall. He couldn’t look over his shoulder to see the condition of the fire as all his muscles were tensed trying to hold himself fast to the wall. He slowly lifted his foot to the next hole and fumbled a couple more times before he felt that he had a solid hold on it. He began to shake and sweat started to bead up on his brow. If his palms started to sweat, he would never get any higher and would just slip off. With trembling limbs he forced himself to keep going. Each time he pulled himself up he felt his strength drain and his worry build. His muscles continued to naturally want to tense and hold himself in position, not wanting to move to the next uneasy step. He had to mentally relax his leg, then his other leg, then each arm as he methodically moved up the wall.

  

Finally within half a meter from the top of the wall, there were no more crumbling bricks. They were all as new as the rest of the bricks. “Of course these bricks wouldn’t be any worse. They don’t throw the ball all the way up here when they are playing,” Marcus thought to himself. Pinned to the wall he tried to look back and see if the fire was still raging. He couldn’t hear it anymore over the blood thumping in his ears and his exasperated breathing. As he looked over his shoulder, to his dismay the fire had almost consumed everything flammable. He was out of time. He looked up and made his decision. Bracing the muscles in his legs he squatted just enough to jump the rest of the way. 

  

It was an awkward jump having almost no foundation to push off of. But his floundering hand caught hold of the top of the wall. With renewed adrenaline he swung his other hand up to the wall and pulled himself up. Swinging his legs up he laid himself atop the wall that was only as wide as his shoulders. Letting his burning muscles relax before he dropped down, he looked over at the academy and courtyard. The fire had gone out except for the remaining smolders but the guards and a new gathering of instructors and students were standing there staring and pointing at the burned marks that remained on the walls. Some poor students were going to be tasked with washing that off the walls the next few weeks. Marcus could only hope it wasn’t him or Jason.

  

From atop the wall Marcus could get a better view of the academy and its horseshoe shape. The west wing being the Army and the east wing for the navy. The grand entrance to the west wing and the smoldering remains looked silly now in comparison with the blue banners that still hung on the side of the navy. The courtyard in the middle had students practicing their physical training, running, playing sports and lifting stones carefully carved to have specific weight. Marcus was glad today that he had given it his all during those classes that conditioned them to “march and grunt”. He chuckled to himself remembering Eva’s joke.

  

Marcus decided he should get moving before someone looked up here and thought to themselves, “why is there a student on top of the wall?” and “How did he get up there?” and “A great punishment would be to make him clean up this mess out front.”

  

He looked over the edge and down to the street below. There was enough foot traffic that a student dropping from the wall would only cause a stir. People would be too focused on getting to their next destination to be concerned with someone else’s problems. 

  

Marcus swung his legs over the side and then hung by the top of the wall, then dropped the 2 meters to the ground. He absorbed the fall with his knees as he was taught to do in his obstacle classes and indeed rather well. No injury sustained and he didn’t slam back into the wall as he landed. The people around him gasped and looked his way but continued bustling along just as he had hoped. 

  

Marcus decided that this was such a good idea and proceeded to join the throng of citizens, blending in as though he himself was going about the day like a normal Constituto citizen and not a student stuck in the walls of "The Strategic Academy of Dormiens Ignis".
